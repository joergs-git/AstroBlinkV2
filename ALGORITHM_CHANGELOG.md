# Algorithm Changelog

Tracks every change to quality scoring, star detection, noise measurement,
trailing analysis, and all other metric calculation logic.

**IMPORTANT:** Every bump to `kAlgorithmVersion` in `FrameRecord.swift` MUST have
a corresponding entry here. Frame History DB records carry the algorithm version
they were scored with — this changelog is the authoritative reference for what
that version means.

Records with `algorithmVersion < kAlgorithmVersion` are candidates for re-analysis.

## Version 11 — v5.10.2 (2026-04-01)

**Severity-dependent trailing multiplier for narrowband filters.**

### Problem
The flat narrowband trailing multiplier (0.3×) made garbage detection thresholds
mathematically unreachable: trailingScore capped at 1.0, but threshold = 0.7/0.3 = 2.33.
Severe trailing on narrowband (Ha, OIII, SII) was never flagged as garbage, regardless
of how elongated stars were or how strong the consensus.

### Changes
1. **Severity-dependent multiplier**: `baseMult + (1 - baseMult) × trailingScore²`
   - Mild trailing (score < 0.3): mult stays near baseMult (0.30 → 0.36)
   - Moderate trailing (score 0.5): mult escalates to 0.48
   - Severe trailing (score > 0.7): mult approaches 1.0 (full Luminance penalty)
   - Preserves narrowband benefit for mild trailing, escalates for severe cases
2. **Absolute trailing ceiling (Rule 6a)**: trailingScore > 0.50 AND consensus > 0.5 → garbage
   - Filter-independent safety net, does NOT check fwhmRulesOutTrailing
   - Tracking error produces normal FWHM + high eccentricity — consensus is the guard
3. Applied to: Rules 5, 6, Stage 2 z-score weighting, rescue rule trailingOK, SSWEIGHT

### Files modified
- `QualityEstimator.swift` — New `effectiveTrailingMultiplier()`, Rule 6a, updated all
  trailing multiplier usage (Rules 5/6, Stage 2, rescue rules, reasoning labels)
- `FrameRecord.swift` — kAlgorithmVersion 10 → 11
- `ALGORITHM_CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

### Expected impact
- **Narrowband with mild trailing (score < 0.3)**: No meaningful change
- **Narrowband with moderate trailing (score 0.3-0.5)**: Slightly stricter scoring
- **Narrowband with severe trailing (score > 0.65 + consensus)**: Now correctly flagged as garbage
- **RGB/Luminance**: Minimal to no change

## Version 10 — v5.6.0 (2026-03-29)

**Baseline version.** All records in the Frame History DB as of v5.6.0 are set to
this version via migration `v3_algorithm_version_baseline`.

### Active scoring logic at this version:

**Quality Estimator (QualityEstimator.swift)**
- 4-stage pipeline: z-scores → deep analysis → pattern rules → calibration floor
- Combined z-score: FWHM (negated), Stars (direct), Noise MAD (negated), Trailing (negated)
- FWHM and HFR never combined (95% correlated) — FWHM preferred, HFR fallback
- Z-score cap ±3.0 per metric
- Filter-aware trailing penalty: NB ×0.3, RGB ×0.6, L ×1.0, unknown ×0.7
- Quality tiers: Trash (0), Borderline (1), Good (2), Excellent (3), Uncertain (4)
- Uncertain tier: group <8 frames AND combinedZ in [-1.0, 0.5]

**Stage 1 — Garbage Detection Rules:**
- R1: Missing critical data (no noise stats)
- R1b: Decentered target (CRVAL shift >30% FOV)
- R2: Star count anomaly with FWHM/HFR cross-check
- R5: FL-adaptive eccentricity (ecc >2× baseline = garbage)
- R7: Background anomaly (positive deviation only, moon-aware for broadband)
- R8: FWHM rules out trailing (FWHM ≤ median×1.15 → no trailing garbage)
- R10: Twilight detection (narrowband: civil, broadband: nautical)
- fwhmRulesOutTrailing prevents false trailing garbage on good-focus frames

**Stage 1.5 — Session-Wide Sanity Check:**
- Cross-group P10/P90 comparison (pools by object+exposure, ignores filter/night)
- 2+ flags = trash, severe FWHM outlier (>1.4× P10) + 1 flag = trash
- Multi-group guard: ≥2 filter/night combos required

**Stage 3 — Rescue Rules:**
- Promotion only, never demotion
- isLockedKeep (calibration floor) → minimum tier .good

**Star Metrics (StarMetricsCalculator.swift)**
- Center-crop 70% for measurement
- Adaptive aperture: min(15, max(5, medianFWHM × 2.5))
- 60 measured stars, 10px crowding, full-res refinement
- Bright star annular measurement (skip saturated core)
- Position angle extraction via doubled-angle method

**Trailing Analysis (TrailingAnalyzer.swift)**
- Orientation consensus: ±20° of mean PA, >50% = systematic
- FL baseline: 0.8 / sqrt(focalLength / 200)
- trailingScore = excessEcc × consensusMultiplier
- Filter-independent detection (penalty response is filter-aware in QualityEstimator)

**Noise Measurement (STFCalculator.swift)**
- Center-crop 70%
- 5% random subsample (seed 42)
- Median + MAD (normalized ×1.4826)
- SNR = noiseMedian / noiseMAD

**Calibration (CalibrationDatabase.swift)**
- Welford online algorithm for incremental mean/variance/MAD
- ≥30 frames threshold before absolute quality floor activates
- Frames within 1 MAD of learned baseline → isLockedKeep

**SSWEIGHT Formula:**
- `clamp(0, 100, 50 + qualityZScore*20) * (1 - trailingScore*0.5*filterTrailingMult)`
- Locked KEEP frames: minimum weight 50

## How to bump the version

1. Make your change to scoring/detection/metric logic
2. Increment `kAlgorithmVersion` in `FrameRecord.swift`
3. Add a new section above with:
   - Version number and app version
   - What changed and why
   - Which files were modified
   - Expected impact on existing scores (e.g. "frames with X will now score higher")
4. Commit both the logic change and changelog together

## Files that require a version bump when modified:

- `QualityEstimator.swift` — scoring weights, tier thresholds, garbage rules, rescue rules
- `TrailingAnalyzer.swift` — consensus algorithm, FL baseline, trailing score formula
- `StarMetricsCalculator.swift` — aperture sizing, star selection, PA extraction
- `STFCalculator.swift` — noise measurement (measureNoise method only)
- `CalibrationDatabase.swift` — floor logic, lock criteria, Welford parameters
- `ConvergenceDetector.swift` — convergence thresholds (affects culling recommendations)
- `ColorCombineEngine.swift` — filter alias mapping (affects filter identification)

## Files that do NOT require a version bump:

- UI changes (display, layout, colors, labels)
- Navigation, keyboard shortcuts, menu items
- Pre-caching pipeline (decode, stretch, GPU rendering)
- Import/export (SSWEIGHT writing, CSV backup)
- AIsaac AI assistant
- Benchmark sharing, community detection service
- In-app messaging
