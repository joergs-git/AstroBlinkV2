# Changelog

All notable changes to AstroBlinkV2 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [3.6.0] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- **GPU-Accelerated Star Metrics**: HFR (Half-Flux Radius) and FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) are now automatically computed for every image during session loading using GPU star detection + CPU Gaussian fitting. No external software or FITS header data required.
- **ROTATOR-based Meridian Flip Detection**: For mounts without PIERSIDE header (e.g. ZWO ASIAIR on AM5), AstroBlinkV2 now detects meridian flips from the ROTATOR angle (~180° change).
- **"Night" column**: New default-visible column showing the astronomical observing night (evening date). Images captured after midnight are correctly attributed to the previous evening's session.
- **Header Inspector: Copy support**: Multi-row selection with Cmd+Click/Shift+Click, Cmd+C to copy selected rows as "KEY = VALUE" lines, plus a "Copy All" button.
- **Quality score tooltips**: Hovering over the Q column now explains the score meaning or why it's empty (e.g. "needs ≥20 images per group").

### Changed
- **Column order**: Quality metrics (Q, SNR, FWHM, HFR) now grouped together right after Filter for quick scanning. "Date" column moved to hidden-by-default (replaced by "Night").
- **Observing night grouping**: Quality scoring and Session Overview now group by astronomical night (evening date) instead of calendar date. Sessions spanning midnight are no longer split into two groups.
- **Star detection shared**: Extracted star detection into shared `StarDetector` utility used by both QuickStack engines and the new star metrics pipeline.

### Fixed
- **FWHM computation**: Replaced coarse 0.5px annuli radial profile (always returned ~2.50) with linearized Gaussian fit for accurate, per-star FWHM values.
- **Star metrics coverage**: Relaxed star filtering criteria (saturation 95%→98%, edge margin 15→12px, crowding distance 20→15px, min stars 3→2) so more images get computed metrics.
- **Stars column**: No longer shows internal measurement count (capped at 30). Only displays header/filename-sourced star counts to avoid confusion.
